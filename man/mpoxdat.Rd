\format{

}
\usage{
data(mpoxdat)
}
\description{
Surveillance data from from the New York City Health Departmentâ€™s mpox surveillance database.
}
\details{
This is line-list data with each row representing case counts. The columns are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{dx_date}: first positive mpox laboratory result
\item \code{dx_report_date}: the first positive mpox laboratory result was received by the NYC Health Department
\item \code{n}: the case count of individuals within those dates.
\item \code{race}: the race corresponding to those cases. Race was randomly assigned with probabilities
"Non-Hispanic White" = 0.309, "Hispanic" = 0.283, "Black" = 0.202, "Asian" = 0.156, and "Other" = 0.05
which follow what has been reported for the US Census.
}
}
\note{
While \code{dx_date}, \code{dx_report_date} and \code{n} correspond to actual observed data the \code{race} was
constructed exclusively for the examples of this package. Its a synthetic (simulated) variable
and does not correspond to any reality.
