`diseasenowcasting` is an R package for nowcasting time series of epidemiological cases. Epidemiologic surveillance tools usually have an intrinsic delay between the **true date** of an event and the **report date** for that event. Some examples include the **true date** being symptom onset or testing time and the **report date** corresponds to when the case was registered in the system. `diseasenowcasting` uses Bayesian structural time series models (via the probabilistic programming language [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/)) to infer the cases that have not yet been reported thus providing a prediction of the final number of cases. 

> :warning: `diseasenowcasting` is currently under active development and some interface might change from the final version. 

## Installing

To install `diseasenowcasting` you need to use the `remotes` package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes") # <- Uncomment if you have not installed the `remotes` package
remotes::install_github("RodrigoZepeda/diseasenowcasting", dependencies = c("Imports","Suggests"))
```

## Example

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
set.seed(6728)
library(diseasenowcasting)
library(dplyr)
```

For this example we will use the `denguedat` dataset that comes with the package. 

```{r}
#Load example dataset
data(denguedat)
```

The [nowcast()] function performs the `nowcast`. The things required are the `true_date` and `report_date` and `strata` (if exists). 

```{r}
#Use just a subsample of the data for the example
denguedat <- denguedat |> 
  filter(report_week <= as.Date("1990/08/01", format = "%Y/%m/%d"))

#Run the nowcast model stratified by gender. Refresh = 0 makes it quiet
ncast <- nowcast(denguedat, true_date = "onset_week", report_date = "report_week", 
                       strata = "gender", refresh = 0)
```

The `summary` and `plot` options allow you to use the predictions:

```{r}
#Create a nice plot for the predictions
plot(ncast, datesbrakes = "1 month")
```
